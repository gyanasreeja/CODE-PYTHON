Left Index

Given a sorted array of integers of size N and a number X. Find the leftmost index of X in the array arr[].

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7}
X = 1
Output: 0 
Explanation: Because the element 1   
appears twice and its left most 
occurrence is at index 0.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {2, 2, 3, 3, 4}
X = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: Because element 4 appears 
only once at index 4.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function leftIndex() which takes the array arr[], its size N and an integer X as input parameters and returns the leftmost occurrence of X in arr[]. If X is not present in the array, return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
-105 <= arr[i] <= 105
Array may contain duplicate elements.

class Solution:
    def leftIndex (self, N, arr, X):
        # code here 
        low=0
        high=N-1
        while low<=high:
            mid=(low+high)//2
            if arr[mid]<X:
                low=mid+1
            elif arr[mid]>X:
                high=mid-1
                
            else:
                if mid==0 or arr[mid-1]!=arr[mid]:
                    return mid
                else:
                    high=mid-1
        return -1
